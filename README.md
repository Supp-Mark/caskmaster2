# Caskmaster 2

The original Caskmaster (or Caskmaster 1) was a piece of bespoke software commissioned for a leading Cider Producer in the South West. I wanted to spend some time to rebuild it and release it as an Open Source Product.

Caskmaster 2 has been written in PHP and uses the FlightPHP Micro-framework.
